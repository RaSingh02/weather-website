### React Based Weather Website

My first project using the React framework for Javascript. Utilizes Node and NPM to install some dependencies. This project utilizes the OpenWeather API to gather the weather data, linked below. This is the full project, the build file is called "weather." In order to make the project work, you must do these steps:

In app.js: Add your own OpenWeather API key. (https://openweathermap.org/)

Install any dependencies, if needed, run: npm install

Create the build, run: npm run build
